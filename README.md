# The Incredible PyTorch

## What is this?
This is inspired by the famous [Awesome TensorFlow](https://github.com/jtoy/awesome-tensorflow) repository where this repository would hold tutorials, projects, libraries, videos, papers, books and anything related to the incredible [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/).
